There are numerous objects and asteroids in the vastness of space, some of which are closer to Earth than we may think. Even while 70,000 km may not seem like much in our day-to-day lives, on an astronomical scale, it is a modest distance that has the ability to interfere with a number of natural occurrences. Some of these heavenly bodies, particularly asteroids, might be dangerous to Earth. It is crucial to locate and catalog these near-Earth objects (NEOs) that have been confirmed by NASA as being in close proximity to our planet in order to protect our security and get a better knowledge of our cosmic surroundings.
We are better able to evaluate the hazards these NEOs may pose and create mitigation plans for any possible harm they could cause by locating and tracking them. Using this dataset, we can better understand the celestial bodies surrounding Earth and can make informed decisions to safeguard our planet from the potential cosmic threats we may face by these NROs.
